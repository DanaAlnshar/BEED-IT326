# iT326 Project - KSU 
# EEG Epilepsy Classification

## Project Information 

### Problem Statement

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Diagnosing seizures through EEG signals is often challenging and time-consuming. This project addresses the problem by developing a system that can automatically classify EEG signals to support early detection and diagnosis.  

### Objectives 

The objective of this project is to apply data mining techniques on the **BEED EEG Epilepsy dataset** by performing:  

1. **Classification**: Classify brainwave (EEG) signals into four categories:  
   - a. Healthy  
   - b. Generalized seizures  
   - c. Focal seizures  
   - d. Seizure events  

2. **Clustering**: Identify hidden patterns in EEG signals.  

3. **Exploration**: Understand the dataset structure and demonstrate how data mining can be applied to solve healthcare-related problems.  


### Motivation
   We chose this dataset because epilepsy is a serious health issue, and analyzing EEG signals can support early detection and diagnosis. Using this dataset enables us to apply data mining techniques to a real-world healthcare problem, which makes the project meaningful, practical and impactful.  


## Dataset  

this project uses the **BEED EEG Epilepsy dataset**, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The raw data is stored in `Dataset/Raw_dataset.zip` file.  

There’s also a research paper included in `Dataset/Paper.pdf`. that applies classification/clustering on EEG data, which can be useful as a reference.
